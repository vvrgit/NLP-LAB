Notwithstanding the successes and\\nfuture potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of\\nthe potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are\\nperceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust\\nin critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are\\ncurrently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI\\ndevelopments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption.\\nTo bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding\\nprinciples drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best\\npractices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These\\nguiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)\\nFairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness\\nand (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are\\nfurther translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying,\\ndeveloping, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically\\ntrustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice.\",\n          \"To ensure safety in automated driving, the correct perception of the\\nsituation inside the car is as important as its environment. Thus, seat\\noccupancy detection and classification of detected instances play an important\\nrole in interior sensing. By the knowledge of the seat occupancy status, it is\\npossible to, e.g., automate the airbag deployment control. Furthermore, the\\npresence of a driver, which is necessary for partially automated driving cars\\nat the automation levels two to four can be verified. In this work, we compare\\ndifferent statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approach\\nthe problem of background-foreground segmentation in camera based interior\\nsensing. In the recent years, several methods based on different techniques\\nhave been developed and applied to images or videos from different\\napplications. The peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing is,\\nthat the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well as\\ndynamic elements. In data considered in this work, even the camera position is\\nnot completely fixed. We review and benchmark three different methods ranging,\\ni.e., Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Morphological Snakes and a deep neural\\nnetwork, namely a Mask R-CNN. In particular, the limitations of the classical\\nmethods, GMM and Morphological Snakes, for interior sensing are shown.\\nFurthermore, it turns, that it is possible to overcome these limitations by\\ndeep learning, e.g.\\\\ using a Mask R-CNN. Although only a small amount of ground\\ntruth data was available for training, we enabled the Mask R-CNN to produce\\nhigh quality background-foreground masks via transfer learning. Moreover, we\\ndemonstrate that certain augmentation as well as pre- and post-processing\\nmethods further enhance the performance of the investigated methods.\",\n          \"In this paper, we proposed a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) to\\neffectively exploit the unlabeled hard regions for semi-supervised medical\\nimage segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep\\nmodels trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain\\nand easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g. adhesive\\nedges or thin branches) for the image segmentation task. Leveraging these\\nregion-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation\\nmodel training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists\\nof two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple\\nsightly different decoders (i.e. using different up-sampling strategies). The\\nstatistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the\\nmodel's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, a new\\nmutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoder's probability\\noutput and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the\\nmodel's uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariant\\nand low-entropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data, in order\\nto learn a generalized feature representation. We compared the segmentation\\nresults of the MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on\\nthree public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two common\\nsemi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over\\nother existing methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised\\nmedical image segmentation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"terms\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']\",\n          \"['cs.CV']\",\n          \"['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates a comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline using the NLTK library and regular expressions on the 'arxiv_data.csv' dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Steps Performed:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Data Loading**: The `arxiv_data.csv` dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame. To handle potential parsing issues in large CSVs, we specifically loaded the first 1000 rows using `pd.read_csv('arxiv_data.csv', engine='python', nrows=1000)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Initial Text Preprocessing (Custom Function with `re` module)**:\n",
        "    A custom function `preprocess_text` was defined and applied to the 'summaries' column. This function performs the following cleaning operations:\n",
        "    *   Removal of URLs (http, https, www patterns).\n",
        "    *   Removal of HTML tags (<...*>).\n",
        "    *   Removal of social media mentions (@username).\n",
        "    *   Removal of hashtags (#hashtag).\n",
        "    *   Conversion of all text to lowercase.\n",
        "    *   Removal of emojis using a comprehensive regex pattern.\n",
        "    *   Removal of any remaining special characters (keeping only alphanumeric and spaces).\n",
        "    *   Normalization of whitespace (reducing multiple spaces to single spaces and stripping leading/trailing spaces).\n",
        "    The output of this step was stored in the `processed_summaries` column.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Word Tokenization (NLTK)**:\n",
        "    The `processed_summaries` were then tokenized into individual words using NLTK's `word_tokenize` function. The necessary 'punkt_tab' resource was downloaded if not already present. This resulted in the `tokenized_summaries` column, where each entry is a list of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Stopword Removal (NLTK)**:\n",
        "    Common English stopwords were removed from the `tokenized_summaries` to filter out words that carry little semantic meaning. NLTK's 'stopwords' corpus was downloaded as needed. The resulting lists of words were stored in the `filtered_summaries` column.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Lemmatization (NLTK)**:\n",
        "    Lemmatization was applied to the `filtered_summaries` using NLTK's `WordNetLemmatizer`. This process reduces words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., 'running' to 'run', 'better' to 'good'). The 'wordnet' corpus was downloaded to support this. The lemmatized words were stored in the `lemmatized_summaries` column.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Rejoining Words**: The lemmatized words were then rejoined into a single string for each summary, creating a clean, preprocessed text. This final output is available in the `clean_summaries` column.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  **Unified NLTK Preprocessing Pipeline Function**: All the individual preprocessing steps (from step 2 to 5) were consolidated into a single, comprehensive Python function named `nltk_preprocessing_pipeline`. This function takes raw text as input and performs the entire sequence of cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization, returning the final clean summary string. It also includes checks to download necessary NLTK data (punkt_tab, stopwords, wordnet, omw-1.4) to ensure self-sufficiency. This function was then applied to the original 'summaries' column to create `clean_summaries_pipeline`, verifying its consistency with the step-by-step approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "This pipeline provides a robust framework for preparing text data for various natural language processing tasks."
